I tried using supplements as recommended by  Julia Ross in her book The Mood Cure but they were not effective for me  My depression became so severe last Oct that I had to go back on to an antidepressant Bupropion but this medication made my depression much worse  I was then put onto Trintellix in April  The Trintellix was helpful but side effects soon began to appear  

I happened upon an article about a psychiatrist who had used niacin for treating depression   When I googled niacin and depression I came upon many other blogs and comments from other people who also found niacin to be effective against their struggles with depression 

 I was desperate to find an alternative to taking antidepressants so  weeks ago I began supplementing with niacin plus vitamin C   I had already been taking a vitamin B multi magnesium fish oil and Vit D  I started with mcg niacin and have been gradually increasing the dose by mcg increments each day  I use only the regular niacin not the timed release nor the nonflushing type

Since I started taking the additional niacin amp vitamin C  I find that my depression ishas diminished significantly  I am no longer suffering from that bottomless well of depressive  feelings that had been with me since last fall  I stopped taking the Trintellix   weeks ago and my depression has continued to lift",10,2015-06-19,185

24509,Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes,Bowel Preparation,"My colonoscopy was booked in for late afternoon on a Thursday The hospital said to stop eating anything from pm on the Wednesday and recommended giving some detail a non fibre diet from Tuesday evening until Wednesday noon  avoiding dark drinks and jelly like blackcurrant flavour Avoid red meat sausages and pies fruit vegetables and salad potato skins or fries wholemeal or brown bread nuts pulses baked beans wholemeal pasta brown rice puddings containing fruit or nuts cakes and biscuits yoghurts Preferred are white skinless meat like chicken grilled or poached fish cheese eggs white bread pasta rice boiled or mashed potatoes water fizzy drinks fruit squash not blackcurrant clear soups tea or coffee shredless marmalade or jam ice cream custard clear jelly butter margarine 

The hospital also instructed me to start taking Moviprep one packet A  B at pm Wednesday evening and then another packet AB starting from am Thursday On each occasion I was told to drink the mixture at ml a time over  to  hours On each occasion I was also to take ml of clear water AND to take some sugary drinks to maintain blood sugar levels ndash nondiet carbonated drinks ie Coca Cola Lucozade or ginger ale any other clear sugary fluids such as clear apple juice but NOT other fruit juices water alone not being sufficient A spoonful of honey is suggested if sugary drinks are not liked

On Wednesday evening I mixed the two Moviprep packets A  B with  litre of water in a large jug It tasted mildly of lemon but because of warnings about taste I downed each ml in seconds rather than sip it so as not to have to agonise over the taste Starting at am the fourth dose was finished at pm The drug started having an effect at about pm and thereafter it was a matter of getting to the lavatory frequently and quickly for about  to  hours I went to bed at midnight but had to get up again at am and two more occasions up to am though not in so much of a hurry I took the ml of water after the final dose and about ml of Lucozade after that  I was also told to use what we in the UK call vaseline to prevent soreness of skin on the buttocks This I did not do but regretted it Just before midnight I was so sore that I did apply some vaseline ready for Thursday morning and it paid dividends 

On Thursday morning I went through the same procedure again applying the vaseline again before starting This time the emissions were yellow and eventually pretty clear Also the emissions pretty much though not entirely finished by am much quicker than the night before I can only assume there was nothing left to eject All in all it was not a pleasant chore but a fair price to pay to get the job done",10,2016-03-17,42

I happen to be out of my Albuterol inhaler until I see my doctor later this week so Im experiencing Qvar with no backup system and I find it to be very ineffective against my asthma Im using it twice a day two puffs each time as prescribed and though it doesnt make my asthma worse it doesnt appear to improve it either Except for short spurts during the middle of the day which might just be incidental Anyway Im going to ask my doctor for another alternative to Advair because Qvars just not working",2,2017-03-20,5

66458,Valacyclovir,Cold Sores,"Valtrex is fantastic if used correctly for cold sores  For adults the dose is  grams at first symptom of a cold sore followed by  grams  hours later  Thats it  Now the key is getting that first dose right when you feel the first symptom tingling burning swelling etc  This medicine has worked great for me and usually prevents the sore from breaking the skin thus no one even knowing I was getting a cold sore  Anyone who gets cold sores knows how awful they are and how long they take to heal  I have not had as much success with acyclovir

Be sure you always have some Valtrex on hand  If you wait until you get a cold sore before calling the doctor its probably too late but take it anyway to reduce healing time",9,2011-11-12,7
